# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
In this project, I have analysed tweets of 45th president of USA, Donald Trump.  The sentiment of tweets is divided into three parts. 
       
        1. Positive, 
        2. Negative 
        3. Neutral.

Here, I have used Google colab (Jupyter notebook is also works).

##	Libraries used:

**Tweepy**

  - Tweepy is a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. It is useful to get tweets from timeline. Follow and unfollow user. Create and delete tweets. For that you need twitter developer account.

**Pandas** 
  - Pandas stands for “Python Data Analysis Library”.  It is useful for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning. 

**Numpy** 
  - Numpy is useful for adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Re (Regular expression) and WordCloud**

**TextBlob**
  - TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

**Matplotlib** 
  - Matplotlib is a basic library that enables many other libraries to run and plot on its base including seaborn or wordcloud.
  
  
## Steps:

First, I generated Twitter API credentials (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token secret).  For this I have created twitter developer account and created new application. 
1.	Use this link to create developer account. ( https://developer.twitter.com/ ). After applying for developer account, this Screen will be there. If you already have some applications, then it will show list of applications in place of No apps here.

2.	In the next phase you have to add some details of Application. Such as App Name(required), App description(required), Website URL(add github link) , and How app will be used(You can write any thing). No need too fills other details.

3.	After creating App, you will find this screen. For Consumer Api Keys and Access token api go to Keys and tokens.

2.  After Cleaning data (Removed unnecessary hyperlink and user names from tweets)

3.  Using TextBlob library, added Subjectivity and Polarity of tweets.

4.  Plotted a wordcloud of size 500*300.

5.  On the basis of Polarity, tweets are divided into Positive, Negative ane Neutral.

6.  Positive, Negative and Neutral tweets.
